// Word: the common words, the dictionary's 4-letter words (words.js) that most people know
// (1,524 of them), none of them a plural. The group game deals from them and Learn words shows them, never a blocked
// one; a guess can still be any word in words.js, plurals too.
//
// From SCOWL 2020.12.07 (http://wordlist.aspell.net): sizes 10, 20 and 35 (the words found in most dictionaries) of
// english-words, american-words, british-words and british_z-words (Oxford spelling), keeping all-lowercase words of
// 4 letters a-z that are also in words.js. Then the plurals were taken out by hand: a word's -s form ("bags", "runs")
// or one like "mice", but not a word that just ends in s ("this", "lens").
